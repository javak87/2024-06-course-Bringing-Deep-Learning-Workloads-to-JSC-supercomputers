---

### What is a supercomputer?

- Compute cluster: Many computers bound together locally 
- Supercomputer: A damn lot of computers bound together locally😒
  - with a fancy network 🤯

---

### Anatomy of a supercomputer

-  Login Nodes: Normal machines, for compilation, data transfer,  scripting, etc. No GPUs.
- Compute Nodes: Guess what? 
  - For compute! With GPUs! 🤩
- High-speed, ultra-low-latency network
- Shared networked file systems
- Some numbers we should (more or less) know about them:
    - Nodes
    - Cores, Single-core Performance
    - RAM
    - Network: Bandwidth, Latency
    - Accelerators (e.g. GPUs)

---

## How do I use a Supercomputer?

- Batch: For heavy compute, ML training
- Interactively: Jupyter

---

### You don't use the whole supercomputer

#### You submit jobs to a queue asking for resources

![](images/supercomputer-queue.svg)

---

### You don't use the whole supercomputer

#### And get results back

![](images/supercomputer-queue-2.svg)

---

### You don't use the whole supercomputer

#### You are just submitting jobs via the login node

![](images/supercomputer-queue-3.svg)

---

### You don't use the whole supercomputer

#### You are just submitting jobs via the login node

![](images/supercomputer-queue-4.svg)

---

### You don't use the whole supercomputer

#### You are just submitting jobs via the login node

![](images/supercomputer-queue-5.svg)

---

### You don't use the whole supercomputer



::: {.container}
:::: {.col}
- Your job(s) enter the queue, and wait for its turn
- When there are enough resources for that job, it runs

---

### You don't use the whole supercomputer

#### And get results back

![](images/queue-finished.svg)

---

### Supercomputer Usage Model
- Using the the supercomputer means submitting a job to a batch system.
- No node-sharing. The smallest allocation for jobs is one compute node (4 GPUs).
- Maximum runtime of a job: 24h.

---

### Recap:

- Login nodes are for submitting jobs, move files, compile, etc
- NOT FOR TRAINING NEURAL NETS

---

### Recap:

- User submit jobs
- Job enters the queue
- When it can, it runs
- Sends results back to user

---

### Connecting to Jureca DC

#### Getting compute time
- Go to [https://go.fzj.de/dl-in-neuroscience-project-join](https://go.fzj.de/dl-in-neuroscience-project-join)
- Join the course project `training2441`
- Sign the Usage Agreements ([Video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mEN1GmWyGFp75uMIi4d6Tpek2NC_X8eY/view))
- Compute time allocation is based on compute projects. For every compute job, a compute project pays.
- Time is measured in core-hours. One hour of Jureca DC is 128 core-hours.
- Example: Job runs for 8 hours on 64 nodes of Jureca DC: 8 * 64 * 128 = 65536 core-h!

---

## Jupyter

[jupyter-jsc.fz-juelich.de](https://jupyter-jsc.fz-juelich.de)

- Jupyter-JSC uses the queue 
- When you are working on it, you are using project time ⌛️
- *Yes, if you are just thinking and looking at the 📺, you are burning project time*🤦‍♂️
- It's useful for small tests - not for full-fledged development 🙄

---

## Jupyter


![](images/jupyter-partition.png)

---

## Working with the supercomputer's software

- We have literally thousands of software packages, hand-compiled for the specifics of the supercomputer.
- [Full list](https://www.fz-juelich.de/en/ias/jsc/services/user-support/using-systems/software)
- [Detailed documentation](https://apps.fz-juelich.de/jsc/hps/jureca/software-modules.html)

## Luncher in Jupyter-JSC
![](images/launcher-jupyter-jsc.png)


## Software

### Connect to terminal

![](images/jupyter-terminal.png)

---

### Tool for finding software: `module spider`

```bash
strube1$ module spider PyTorch
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  PyTorch:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Description:
      Tensors and Dynamic neural networks in Python with strong GPU acceleration. 
      PyTorch is a deep learning framework that puts Python first.

     Versions:
        PyTorch/1.7.0-Python-3.8.5
        PyTorch/1.8.1-Python-3.8.5
        PyTorch/1.11-CUDA-11.5
        PyTorch/1.12.0-CUDA-11.7
     Other possible modules matches:
        PyTorch-Geometric  PyTorch-Lightning
...
```

---

## What do we have?

`module avail` (Inside hierarchy)

---

## Module hierarchy

- Stage (full collection of software of a given year)
- Compiler
- MPI
- Module

- Eg: `module load Stages/2023 GCC OpenMPI PyTorch`

---

#### What do I need to load such software?

`module spider Software/version`

---

## Example: PyTorch

Search for the software itself - it will suggest a version

![](images/module-spider-1.png)

---

## Example: PyTorch

Search with the version - it will suggest the hierarchy

![](images/module-spider-2.png)

---

## Example: PyTorch

(make sure you are still connected to Jureca DC)

```bash
$ python
-bash: python: command not found
```

Oh noes! 🙈

Let's bring Python together with PyTorch!

---

## Example: PyTorch

Copy and paste these lines
```bash
# This command fails, as we have no proper python
python 
# So, we load the correct modules...
module load Stages/2024
module load GCC OpenMPI Python PyTorch
# And we run a small test: import pytorch and ask its version
python -c "import torch ; print(torch.__version__)" 
```

Should look like this:
```bash
$ python
-bash: python: command not found
$ module load Stages/2024
$ module load GCC OpenMPI Python PyTorch
$ python -c "import torch ; print(torch.__version__)" 
2.1.0
```
---

## Python Modules

#### Some of the python softwares are part of Python itself, or of other softwares. Use "`module key`"

```bash
module key toml
The following modules match your search criteria: "toml"
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Jupyter: Jupyter/2020.2.5-Python-3.8.5, Jupyter/2021.3.1-Python-3.8.5, Jupyter/2021.3.2-Python-3.8.5, Jupyter/2022.3.3, Jupyter/2022.3.4
    Project Jupyter exists to develop open-source software, open-standards, and services for interactive computing across dozens of programming languages.
    

  PyQuil: PyQuil/3.0.1
    PyQuil is a library for generating and executing Quil programs on the Rigetti Forest platform.

  Python: Python/3.8.5, Python/3.9.6, Python/3.10.4
    Python is a programming language that lets you work more quickly and integrate your systems more effectively.

python matrix.py
```

---

### But that's not what we want... 😒

---

### So we send it to the queue!

---

## HOW?🤔

---

### SLURM 🤯
![](images/slurm.jpg)

Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management

---

### Slurm submission file

- Simple text file which describes what we want and how much of it, for how long, and what to do with the results

---

### Slurm submission file example

Create a file named `jureca-matrix.sbatch` as described in the previous section, and copy all the content from the following into this file.

``` {.bash .number-lines}
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --account=training2441           # Who pays?
#SBATCH --nodes=1                        # How many compute nodes
#SBATCH --job-name=matrix-multiplication
#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=1              # How many mpi processes/node
#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=1                # How many cpus per mpi proc
#SBATCH --output=output.%j        # Where to write results
#SBATCH --error=error.%j
#SBATCH --time=00:01:00          # For how long can it run?
#SBATCH --partition=dc-gpu         # Machine partition
#SBATCH --reservation=training2441 # For today only

module load Stages/2024
module load GCC OpenMPI PyTorch  # Load the correct modules on the compute node(s)

srun python matrix.py            # srun tells the supercomputer how to run it
```

---

### Submitting a job: SBATCH

```bash
sbatch jureca-matrix.sbatch

Submitted batch job 412169
```

---

### Are we there yet?

![](images/are-we-there-yet.gif)

--- 

### Are we there yet? 🐴

`squeue --me`

```bash
squeue --me
   JOBID  PARTITION    NAME      USER    ST       TIME  NODES NODELIST(REASON)
   412169 gpus         matrix-m  strube1 CF       0:02      1 jsfc013

```

#### ST is status:

- PD (pending), 
- CF(configuring), 
- R (running),   
- CG (completing)

---

### Reservations

- Some partitions have reservations, which means that only certain users can use them at certain times.
- For this course, it's called `training2441`

--- 

### Job is wrong, need to cancel

```bash
scancel <JOBID>
```

---

### Check logs

#### By now you should have output and error log files on your directory. Check them!

simply open `output.412169` and `error.412169` using Editor!!

---

## Extra software, modules and kernels

#### You want that extra software from `pip`....

[Venv/Kernel template](https://gitlab.jsc.fz-juelich.de/kesselheim1/sc_venv_template)

```bash
cd $HOME/course/
git clone https://gitlab.jsc.fz-juelich.de/kesselheim1/sc_venv_template.git
```

---

## Example: Let's install some software!

- Even though we have PyTorch, we don't have PyTorch Lightning Flash
- Same for fast.ai and wandb
- We will install them in a virtual environment

---

### Example: Let's install some software!

- Edit the file sc_venv_template/requirements.txt

- Add these lines at the end: 
-
 ```bash
fastai
wandb
accelerate
deepspeed
```

- Run on the terminal: `sc_venv_template/setup.sh`

---

### Example: Activating the virtual environment

- ```bash
source sc_venv_template/activate.sh
```

---

### Example: Activating the virtual environment

```bash
source ./activate.sh 
The activation script must be sourced, otherwise the virtual environment will not work.
Setting vars
The following modules were not unloaded:
  (Use "module --force purge" to unload all):
 1) Stages/2024
```

```bash
jureca01 $ python
Python 3.11.3 (main, Jun 25 2023, 13:17:30) [GCC 12.3.0]
>>> import fastai
>>> fastai.__version__
'2.7.14'

```

---

### Let's train a 🐈 classifier!

- This is a minimal demo, to show some quirks of the supercomputer
- ```bash
code cats.py
```

- ```python 
from fastai.vision.all import *
from fastai.callback.tensorboard import *
#
print("Downloading dataset...")
path = untar_data(URLs.PETS)/'images'
print("Finished downloading dataset")
#
def is_cat(x): return x[0].isupper()
# Create the dataloaders and resize the images
dls = ImageDataLoaders.from_name_func(
    path, get_image_files(path), valid_pct=0.2, seed=42,
    label_func=is_cat, item_tfms=Resize(224))
print("On the login node, this will download resnet34")
learn = vision_learner(dls, resnet34, metrics=accuracy)
cbs=[SaveModelCallback(), TensorBoardCallback('runs', trace_model=True)]
# Trains the model for 6 epochs with this dataset
learn.unfreeze()
learn.fit_one_cycle(6, cbs=cbs)
```

---

### Submission file for the classifier

```bash
code fastai.sbatch
```

```bash
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --account=training2441
#SBATCH --mail-user=MYUSER@fz-juelich.de
#SBATCH --mail-type=ALL
#SBATCH --nodes=1
#SBATCH --job-name=cat-classifier
#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=1
#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=128
#SBATCH --output=output.%j
#SBATCH --error=error.%j
#SBATCH --time=00:20:00
#SBATCH --partition=dc-gpu
#SBATCH --reservation=training2441 # For today only

cd $HOME/course/
source sc_venv_template/activate.sh # Now we finally use the fastai module

srun python cats.py
```

--- 

### Submit it

```bash
sbatch fastai.sbatch
```

---

### Submission time

- Check error and output logs, check queue

---

### Probably not much happening...

- ```bash
$ cat output.7948496 
The activation script must be sourced, otherwise the virtual environment will not work.
Setting vars
Downloading dataset...
```
- ```bash
$ cat err.7948496 
The following modules were not unloaded:
  (Use "module --force purge" to unload all):

  1) Stages/2024
```

---

## 💥

---

## What happened?

- It might be that it's not enough time for the job to give up
- Check the `error.${JOBID}` file
- If you run it longer, you will get the actual error:
- ```python
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/p/project/training2441/strube1/cats.py", line 5, in <module>
    path = untar_data(URLs.PETS)/'images'
    ...
    ...
    raise URLError(err)
urllib.error.URLError: <urlopen error [Errno 110] Connection timed out>
srun: error: jwb0160: task 0: Exited with exit code 1
```

---

## 🤔...

---

### What is it doing?

- This downloads the dataset:
- ```python
path = untar_data(URLs.PETS)/'images'
```

- And this one downloads the pre-trained weights:
- ```python
learn = vision_learner(dls, resnet34, metrics=error_rate)
```

## Compute nodes have no internet connection

- But the login nodes do!
- So we download our dataset before...
  - On the login nodes!

---


## On the login node:

- Comment out the line which does AI training:
- ```python
# learn.fit_one_cycle(6, cbs=cbs)
```
- Call our code on the login node!
- ```bash
source sc_venv_template/activate.sh # So that we have fast.ai library
python cats.py
```

---

## Run the downloader on the login node

```bash
$ source sc_venv_template/activate.sh
$ python cats.py

---

## Run it again on the compute nodes!

- Un-comment back the line that does training:
- ```bash
learn.fit_one_cycle(6, cbs=cbs)
```
- Submit the job!
- ```bash
sbatch fastai.sbatch
```

---

## Masoquistically waiting for the job to run?

```bash
watch squeue --me
```
(To exit, type CTRL-C)

---

## Check output files

- You can see them within VSCode
- ```bash

### Tools for results analysis

- We already ran the code and have results
- To analyze them, there's a neat tool called Tensorboard
- And we already have the code for it on our example!
- ```python
cbs=[SaveModelCallback(), TensorBoardCallback('runs', trace_model=True)]
```

---

## Example: Tensorboard

- The command 
- ```bash
tensorboard --logdir=runs  --port=9999 serve
```
- Opens a connection on port 9999... *OF THE SUPERCOMPUTER*.
- This port is behind the firewall. You can't access it directly... 
- We need to do bypass the firewall 🏴‍☠️
  - SSH PORT FORWARDING

---

## Example: Tensorboard

![](images/supercomputer-firewall.svg)

---

## Port Forwarding

![

---

<!-- ## Port forwarding demo:

- On VSCode's terminal:
- ```bash
cd $HOME/course/
source sc_venv_template/activate.sh
tensorboard --logdir=runs  --port=12345 serve
```
- Note the tab `PORTS` next to the terminal 
- On the browser: [http://localhost:12345](http://localhost:12345)
