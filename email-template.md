What software is necessary for this course?

The course is platform-independent. It can even be followed by a Windows user, but if possible, avoid it. In general. Forever.

- A terminal. On Linux and Mac, it's just called "Terminal". Little familiarity with it is required. On windows, the WSL installs it.

- Some knowledge of the Python language.

The course material is available at https://go.fzj.de/dl-in-neuroscience - I will be making some final commits to it, so make sure you reload it every now and then.

See you soon, 

Alex, Sabrina and Javad
